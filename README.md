Just a simple discord bot.

In order to run it you will need to provide a configuration file.
`config.js`:
```
var config = {
	//Port number for ssh connection.
	port: '55722',
	//User Name for ssh connection.
	user: 'alarm',
	//Path for ssh key.
	sshkey: '~/.ssh/mopi',
	//Network device.
	dev: 'wlp3s0',
	//Owner gets notifications from the bot.
	owner: <OWNER SNOWFLAKE>,
	//Admins can query the bot for ip address.
	admins: [<ADMIN SNOWFLAKE>, <ADMIN SNOWFLAKE>, <ADMIN SNOWFLAKE>],
	//Channel it announces on when it's live.
	channel: <CHANNEL SNOWFLAKE>,
	//Discord API key.
	discordAPIKey: <DISCORD API KEY>
};
module.exports = config;
```

Here is a sample systemd unit file that can be used to start the bot.
`pibot.service`:
```
